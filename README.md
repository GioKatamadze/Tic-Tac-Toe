## My process

1. Change background color of body
2. Add background image
3. Create wrapper div
4. Add icons and text
5. Give icon sizes and styles in CSS
6. Create hover effects for buttons and links
7. Add inputs of X and O
8. Add winner result section
9. Add Javascript code to give CPU functionalities
   10.add Javascript code to make Player vs Player Game flow

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile first approach
- Flexbox
- Grid
- Media Queries
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned

While working on this project, I gained more practise of using Media Queries and Grid layout, the main challenge that I overcame was to create Js Functionality for the game. After research and practicing different ways for resolving this step, I wrote the Js code, that worked eventually and it gave me some confidence and knowledge of making wabsites interactive and dynamic. Js code calculates winning ways and tries CPU to win on Player. On the other hand Player vs Player is created to work without problems and any kind of bugs.

### Continued development

I want to create other projects like this to finally master coding and make more dynamic, interactive and functional projects
